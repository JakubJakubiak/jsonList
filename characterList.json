After the events at Graf Granat's Domain, Graf Granat gifted Fern a dark-blue, long-sleeved dress that she wears with a thick, cropped, light-gray winter jacket and braided scarf in colder settings. This replaced her former winter attire, which consisted solely of a brown shawl over her normal clothes. When she was a child, Fern had short purple hair styled in a straight bob with bangs and decorated with a large red ribbon on the side of her head. She wore very similar clothing to her present-day outfit, consisting of a smaller version of the buttoned white dress and black cloak, with black Mary Jane shoes. Prior to being adopted by Heiter, she wore a light-colored shoulder cape instead of the cloak and possessed a locket with a photo of her family. For her sixteenth birthday, Frieren took Fern out to a location that served dessert in the city of Warm and gifted the girl a butterfly hair ornament which she wears as an everyday accessory on her head's back. As her eighteenth birthday present Sein selects a pouch, with a butterfly motif and gifts it right away. After overcoming a quarrel on this same birthday with Stark, he gifted her an ornate mirrored lotus motif bracelet, which she frequently wears on her left wrist.

Her wolf form's body is slightly larger than that of an elephant's. The upper half of her body is covered in wheat brown fur while the rest is off-white. Her eyes are red with yellow scleras. In her human form, Holo appears as a lovely and beautiful 15-year-old girl with red eyes and long flowing light brown hair that reaches her stomach. A pair of wolf ears jut out from the top of her head and a long, thick wolf tail grows out from the lowest part of her spine. The fur on both her ears and tail are the same color as her wolf form. Because her beast-like features could land her in hot water with the Church, she tends to cover up her ears with hoods or hats, her tail with long following skirts, or both with long hooded cloaks. The outfit she initially wore was a purple shirt with a black, fur-lined vest, a black skirt, black and white pants, and a long beige hooded robe. The linings were black bear fur. After these clothes were destroyed, Holo purchased a pink shirt with purple trim, black pants with matching cuff trim, a red silk sash, a light blue anklet on her right ankle, two high quality hooded robes, and cow leather traveling shoes. Later on, she acquired a headscarf made of white rabbit fur trimmed in dark red, and a black collared short cape fastened with a walnut button and matching trim. Soon after meeting Lawrence, she began wearing a red drawstring pouch attached to a brown leather cord around her neck.",

She has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises, slanted downward toward the sides of her face and framed by notably long eyelashes, the pupils of which can appear slit as she transforms.

Nezuko also wears a small pink ribbon on the left side of her head to keep her hair out of her face, along with the bamboo muzzle Giyu Tomioka gave her, which is secured around her jaw with a strip of red cloth. When Nezuko transforms into her awakened form during her fight with Daki, she has a bigger, taller and curvaceous body and has longer hair that reaches to her feet.

As a human, she had a very similar appearance, the only differences being her lack of demon-like traits, firey-coloured hair, and pale pink eyes. Instead, Nezuko had fully black hair, worn tied back in three low buns, decorated by pink ribbons, and had eyes of a darker pink color. She wore the same kimono, just without her haori and with a white Onbuhimo cloth tied around her, which she used to carry her little brother, Rokuta Kamado, on her back. After becoming human again, these features return, with the exception of her hair which seems to retain its flame-orange tips, a feature that would be passed down to her descendant, Toko.",
