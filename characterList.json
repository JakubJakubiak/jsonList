She usually wears her hair down with two additional chest-length strands framing her face. After her sixteenth birthday, Fern began styling her hair partially tied back with a butterfly hair ornament gifted by Frieren.

As a result of her mature and calm personality, she frequently wears a stoic expression and rarely expresses strong emotions. During her travels with Frieren, Fern is most commonly seen wearing a long, buttoned white dress with a Victorian-style top, including a frilled collar and puffy white sleeves, along with black boots. When outdoors, she also dons a long black coat with a hood, which has a gray inside layer. For her eighteenth birthday, Stark gifted her an ornate mirrored lotus bracelet, which she frequently wears on her left wrist. As a mage, Fern wields a long, wooden staff wrapped with purple ribbons in battle, which was a gift to her from Heiter. After the events at Graf Granat's Domain, Graf Granat gifted Fern a dark-blue, long-sleeved dress that she wears with a thick, cropped, light-gray winter jacket and braided scarf in colder settings. This replaced her former winter attire, which consisted solely of a brown shawl over her normal clothes. When she was a child, Fern had short purple hair styled in a straight bob with bangs and decorated with a large red ribbon on the side of her head. She wore very similar clothing to her present-day outfit, consisting of a smaller version of the buttoned white dress and black cloak, with black Mary Jane shoes. Prior to being adopted by Heiter, she wore a light-colored shoulder cape instead of the cloak and possessed a locket with a photo of her family. For her sixteenth birthday, Frieren took Fern out to a location that served dessert in the city of Warm and gifted the girl a butterfly hair ornament which she wears as an everyday accessory on her head's back. As her eighteenth birthday present Sein selects a pouch, with a butterfly motif and gifts it right away. After overcoming a quarrel on this same birthday with Stark, he gifted her an ornate mirrored lotus motif bracelet, which she frequently wears on her left wrist. The mirrored lotus has the floriography meaning of eternal love, which Stark didn't know at the time and only Sein pointed it out later with Fern overhearing it.",
